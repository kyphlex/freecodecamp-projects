# FreeCodeCamp Projects ðŸ“šðŸ’»

This repository contains all the hands-on Python projects Iâ€™ve built while learning through [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). Each project applies concepts from the curriculum and showcases my ability to go beyond tutorials and build real-world logic.

---

## ðŸš€ Why This Repo?

Learning Python is one thing â€” **building with it is another.**  
This repo documents my progress as I grow from beginner to pro, one project at a time.  
From string manipulation to CLI apps, Iâ€™m turning every lesson into a functional program.

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `01-string-manipulation/` | Projects involving string slicing, logic, and custom ciphers |
| `02-lists-loops/` | Logic-based problems that use Python data structures effectively |
| `03-expense-tracker/` | A CLI-based app to track, view, and filter expenses |
| `04-file-handling/` | Coming soon: Read/write projects using file I/O |
